# coffeelite
The smaller, simpler, **_definitive_** version of the coffee JavaScript library.

## What is Coffee?
No, not the drink.
Coffee is a JavaScript library made by me, designed to make creating games with HTML/JavaScript canvas more straightforward and simple. The library contains many functions related to drawing shapes, text, and images.

## Why Coffee?
While it is still a work in progress, it is a great library for those beginning to make games in JavaScript/HTML.

## Creating a Project
